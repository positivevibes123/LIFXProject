  <h3 align="center">LIFXProject</h3>

  <p align="center">

## About

I originally wrote this program to be able to convienently interact with an LIFX lightbulb that I put in my lamp by my bedside. LIFX has a mobile app, which is convienent but I have some gripes with. As of the creation of this program, 
LIFX does not have a desktop app. There are alternatives out there, however I wanted to develop my own solution as a learning experience and to talor it to my specific wants over time.

## Instructions

In order to use this program, you will need to build the jar and place a .txt file named "token.txt" in the same directory as your jar. The token.txt file contains your API key, pretty self explanatory.

# Usage

<br>
Toggle Power - if bulb is on, turn off and vice versa
</br>

<br>
Choose Color - set lightbulb to color chosen from color picker
</br>
